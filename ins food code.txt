Suji
The standard has  various requirements such as moisture content, protein content, total ash, acid insoluble ash, crude fibre content, alcoholic acidity, aflatoxin content to ensure a good quality and safe product.
Advantages of Suji:
Rich in Nutrients: Suji contains various nutrients, including carbohydrates, protein, fiber, and some vitamins and minerals.
Versatility: It is a versatile ingredient that can be used in various recipes such as upma, halwa, pancakes, and more.
Quick Cooking: Suji cooks relatively quickly, making it a convenient option for preparing meals in a short time.
Texture: It adds a unique texture to dishes, providing a grainy and slightly gritty feel that many people find appealing.
Disadvantages of Suji:
Gluten Content: Suji is made from wheat, so it contains gluten. This can be a disadvantage for individuals with gluten sensitivity or celiac disease.
Calorie Content: While suji does provide essential nutrients, it is also calorie-dense. Consuming it in excess may contribute to an increase in calorie intake.
Blood Sugar Impact: Suji has a high glycemic index, which means it can lead to a rapid increase in blood sugar levels. People with diabetes or those looking to manage their blood sugar should consume it in moderation.
Processing: The processing of wheat to make suji involves removing the bran and germ, which results in a loss of some nutrients, including fiber
